				<header>HawkEye</header>
				<p>
					Hawk-Eye is a computer vision system used in numerous sports such as cricket, tennis, Gaelic football, badminton, hurling, rugby union, association football and volleyball, to visually track the trajectory of the ball and display a profile of its statistically most likely path as a moving image.[1] The onscreen representation of the trajectory results is called Shot Spot.[2]

					The Sony-owned Hawk-Eye system was developed in the United Kingdom by Paul Hawkins.

				<header>How to use this?</header>
				<p>
					In order to use VRWorkout, you will need a virtual reality headset that has at least two motion trackers for your
					hands.
					The Oculus Quest is the recommended headset for this game, as it can be used wirelessly. To get started, simply
					download
					the free game from Steam or the Quest Store. At first, working out in VR may cause nausea, but this will dissipate
					with
					time and eventually become enjoyable.

				<header>How Batsmen use this</header>
				<p>
					Due to its real-time coverage of bowling speed, the system is also used to show delivery patterns of a bowler's behaviour such as line and length, or swing/turn information. At the end of an over, all six deliveries are often shown simultaneously to illustrate a bowler's variations, such as slower deliveries, bouncers and leg-cutters. A complete record of a bowler can also be shown over the course of a match.

					Batsmen also benefit from the analysis of Hawk-Eye

				<header>The History of Hawk-eye</header>
				<p>
					Hawk-Eye was developed in 2000 by engineers at Roke Manor Research Limited, then a Siemens subsidiary in Romsey, England. Paul Hawkins and David Sherry submitted a United Kingdom patent application for the technology, but this was subsequently withdrawn.[6] All of the technology and intellectual property was spun off into a separated company, Hawk-Eye Innovations Ltd, based in Winchester, Hampshire. This was initially established as a joint venture between Roke Manor Research and Sunset + Vine.[7] At the time, Sunset + Vine produced the Channel 4 television cricket coverage where Hawk-Eye was first used.

					On 14 June 2006 a group of investors—led by the Wisden Group and that included Mark Getty, a member of the wealthy American family and business dynasty—bought the company for £4.4m.[7][8] The acquisition was intended to strengthen Wisden's presence in cricket and allow it to enter tennis and other international sports, with Hawk-Eye working on implementing a system for basketball. According to Hawk-Eye's website, the system produces much more data than that shown on television

				<header>Whats in the future?</header>
				<p>
					With VRWorkout, you can get an immersive workout experience that is also free and open source. The app employs no
					sketchy data collection, so you can be sure that your privacy is respected. You can also view the code to see how
					it
					works.

				<header>Problem Solve</header>
				<p>
					When an LBW decision is referred to Hawk-Eye, it assists in assessing against three criteria:

					Where the ball pitched (in particular with respect to the stumps)
					The location of impact on the leg of the batsman (in particular with respect to the stumps)
					The projected path of the ball past the batsman
					In all three cases
